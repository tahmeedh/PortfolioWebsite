The purpose of this application is to provide an efficient and
simple way for students to book study spaces on University of
British Columbia - Okanagan (UBCO).

The current method for booking study spaces requires users to
utilize UBC's study booking website; Which isn't optimized for
mobile browsers and/or smaller devices. As students, we
understand the annoyance that comes with booking study spaces
on campus; This application is designed to serve and improve the
student experience at UBCO.
