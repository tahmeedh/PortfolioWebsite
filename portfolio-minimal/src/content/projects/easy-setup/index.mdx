The Agricultural Information Service is a web app service to enable Kenyan farmers to access agriculturally informative data to produce more crop yields in an efficient manner. The project, which will be developed over the next 3 months, will use a web app to allow farmers to communicate their data to our team and give specific information relevant to the specific farmer, assisting them in being able to grow more crops in a sustainable manner while also providing general agricultural information to users. Using data collected on agricultural crop yields in Kenya (assuming), the web app will give farmers information on the best crops to plant based on their geographical location. Each farmer will be able to create an individual account and add all the relevant information surrounding their property. They will also be able to report to extension officers any issues in relation to the crop‚Äôs leaves, stem or root including, but not limited to, pollution, weather change  and pests. Users will be able to access data regarding popular crops in their area as well as look into the ranking of their own crops. This web app aims to optimize the farming experience in Kenya.
