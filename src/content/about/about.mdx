I am Tahmeed Hossain and I am a fourth year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia.

I found my passion for programming at UBC. Seeing the capabilities of software from building websites/apps to reading/analyzing CT scans and mammography data. Helped build an appreciation for the growing industry.

When I'm not sitting at a computer table, I am usually on the move. I am also Certified Personal Trainer (CPT-CFES) from Okanagan Colllege. My passion for fitness runs just as deep as my passion for programming. I love helping my clients achieve their fitness goals and dreams. One day I intend to put my passion for both together.
