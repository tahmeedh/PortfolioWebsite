I am Tahmeed Hossain and graduated with a Bachelor's of Science majoring in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia.

I am a software engineer with experience in different tech stacks. I am well versed in Java, Python, Reactjs, and Nodejs. I am a keen problem solver and love programming/automation. I am continously learning/researching on topics ranging from AI/ML, Algorithm Analysis, and Blockchain development.

I found my passion for programming at UBC. Seeing the capabilities of software from building websites/apps to reading/analyzing CT scans and mammography data. Helped build an appreciation for the growing industry and it's many unique applications. My goal is help develop scalable software that will an impact on global level and help as many individuals as possible. 

When I'm not sitting at a computer table, I am usually on the move. I am a also Certified Personal Trainer (CPT-CFES) from Okanagan College. My passion for fitness runs just as deep as my passion for programming. I love helping my clients achieve their health & wellness goals. One day I intend to put my passions for fitness and software together that will help people stay active and healthy. Looking to build a scalable solution to help eveyone stay healthy and active for life.
