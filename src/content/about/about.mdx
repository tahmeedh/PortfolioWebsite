I am Tahmeed Hossain and graduated with a Bachelor's of Science majoring in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia.

I have developed on small to medium scale projects. I am well versed in Java, Python, Reactjs, and Nodejs. I am continously learning/researching on topics ranging from AI/ML/DL, Algorithm Analysis, and Digital Signal Processing.

I found my passion for programming at UBC. Seeing the capabilities of software from building websites/apps to reading/analyzing CT scans and mammography data. Helped build an appreciation for the growing industry and it's many unique applications. My goal is help develop scalable software that will an impact on global level and help as many individuals as possible. 

When I'm not sitting at a computer table, I am usually on the move. I am a also Certified Personal Trainer (CPT-CFES) from Okanagan College. My passion for fitness runs just as deep as my passion for programming. I love helping my clients achieve their health & wellness goals. One day I intend to put my passions for fitness and software together that will help people stay active and healthy.
