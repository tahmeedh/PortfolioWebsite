I am Tahmeed Hossain and graduate from Computer Science at the University of British Columbia.

I found my passion for programming at UBC. Seeing the capabilities of software from building websites/apps to reading/analyzing CT scans and mammography data. Helped build an appreciation for the growing industry and it's many unique applications. My goal is help develop software that will an impact on global level and help as many individuals as possible. 

When I'm not sitting at a computer table, I am usually on the move. I am a also Certified Personal Trainer (CPT-CFES) from Okanagan Colllege. My passion for fitness runs just as deep as my passion for programming. I love helping my clients achieve their health & wellness goals. One day I intend to put my passions for fitness and software together that will help people stay active and healthy.
