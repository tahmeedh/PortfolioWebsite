My name is Tahmeed Hossain K and I received my Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia. As a software engineer, I have experience in various tech stacks, including Java, Python, Reactjs, and Nodejs. I am a strong problem solver and enjoy programming and automation. Constantly learning about and researching topics such as AI/ML, algorithm analysis, and blockchain development.

While studying at UBC, I discovered my passion for programming. Seeing the capabilities of software, from building apps to analyzing medical data, helped me appreciate the diverse and growing tech industry. My goal is to develop scalable software that can make a global impact and benefit as many people as possible.

In addition to my career in tech, I am also a Certified Personal Trainer (CPT-CFES) from Okanagan College. My love for fitness is just as strong as my passion for programming. I enjoy helping my clients achieve their health and wellness goals. Eventually, I hope to combine my interests in fitness and software to create a scalable solution that helps people stay active and healthy for life. When I'm not working or training, I enjoy reading technical and non-technical books. My favourite book is Atomic Habits.
