The interactive agent is based on a simple neural-network and deep learning model that can be created using the TensorFlow and TfLearn Python libraries. Created custom tokenized data sets sorted by the pre-processinglibrary (nltk) and stored into dictionary arrays and converted intonumpyarrays to train neural network on user input patterns. Features implemented such as synonym recognition, spelling mistake recognition, and named entity recognition.
